   Hi, this is a simple collector of pokemon data from the web and turning it into an API.

  <strong>Initial Purpose</strong>
   <p>The initial proposal was to develop a <strong>web scraping</strong> that would collect data from the web and transform it into an api. 
   The site from which the information was taken wouldn't make much difference to me, so I decided to look for something fun to work with. Between sports  sites, anime, music and games I ended up deciding on the (https://pokemondb.net/) site. 
What I really wanted was to test my skills and learn new technologies.</p>

   <strong>The Challengers</strong>
   <p>
      Well, among all the challenges I encountered making this little app was how would I get all that information from each of the pokemons on that site. Researching a little, I found a combination of libraries very efficient in this regard, <strong>Selenium</strong> and <strong>Beaultiful</strong> Soup helped me to collect each of the information I wanted with immense practicality.
Another small challenge was how I would create an api quickly with all that information collected, for that <strong>Flask-RESTful</strong> fit like a glove, when I least imagined my api was already in the air and working perfectly.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
   
   <p>
      
The truth is that I had a lot of fun developing this application, in addition to learning how to quickly scrape a website, it's always good to be exploring new content and putting new ideas into practice. The application can be enhanced with new pokemon data, such as attributes, moves, etc. things I want to implement in the future, along with a special face for her.
